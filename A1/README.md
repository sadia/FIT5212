You will train some text classification on a set of 25,000 news articles from ‘BuzzFeed’, ‘Upworthy’, ‘ViralNova’, ‘Thatscoop’, ‘Scoopwhoop’, ‘ViralStories’, ‘WikiNews’, ’New York Times’, ‘The Guardian’, and ‘The Hindu’. Your task is to use the article's headlines to determine whether or not a headline is a clickbait.

## Part 2: Topic Modelling (25 mark)
The data used is the training data from Part 1. Your job is to perform appropriate text preprocessing and preparation and then design two different variations for running LDA using the gensim.models.LdaModel() function call and pre-processing steps such as given in the tutorial. For the pre-processing step, you can use the same pre-processing steps as you used in Part 1.
